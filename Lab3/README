	There are 2 main programs 1 is main that takes no arguments and the node size should be less than or equal to 6 (the size of the test case). The second program is called timing that needs 1 command line argument which is the size of the square matrix for example mpirun -n 10 ./timing 2000 would be a 2000 x 2000 matrix. Timing too needs to have the same or less nodes than the size. To make the main program run make main and to make the timing program run make timing. Make clean removes them. 

	The timings so far are 1.42 seconds for a 2000 x 2000 with 10 nodes, 82.09 seconds for a 6000 x 6000 with 10 nodes, and 382.27 seconds for a 10000 x 10000 with 10 nodes. With 20 nodes it took 379 seconds. So I am not sure if that is too slow.
